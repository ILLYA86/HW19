  <p class="introduction">Hi! My name is Ilya and this is my page.</p>
  <p>I like to travel and learn something new. I am interested in professional car care.</p>
  <p>I took a training course in CarDetailLab on detailing washing, application of protective compounds, etc.</p>
  <p>On the first day of the training, there was a theoretical lesson.</p>
  <p>The second day was allocated for practice, I learned how to prepare the car for polishing,</p>
  <p>to delicately clean the car body from static and indelible contaminants, and to choose the right cleaning compounds.</p>

  <ul> 
    <li><p>A Detailing Wash - is an important part of proper car care.</p></li>
    <li><p>Polishing - is the mechanical removal of a damaged layer of material to restore its shine.</p></li>
    <li><p>Dry cleaning - is an effective and gentle way of cleaning fabric, where the contamination is soaked in a special solvent, which is then extracted using an extractor.</p></li>
    <li><p>Protective compositions - make the paintwork shine and protect it from the external environment.</p></li>
    <li><p>Quartz protective compositions - give the paintwork an extraordinary caramel shine and a powerful hydrophobic effect.</p></li>
